Topics: Sorting + Pointers + Strings (Combined)

Problem:
Create a program that:
- Dynamically allocates an array of 5 strings (each up to 50 chars).
- Sorts them alphabetically using Selection Sort.
- Asks the user for a word to search, and uses pointers to check if it exists.

In baby terms:
You’ll:
- Use malloc() for the list of words.
- Use string comparison (strcmp).
- Sort alphabetically.
- Then scan to see if a word matches.

Sample Input:

Enter 5 words:
banana
apple
watermelon
grape
orange
Enter word to search: grape

Sample Output:

Sorted list:
apple
banana
grape
orange
watermelon

"grape" found in the list!

Test Cases:

Words: dog, cat, bird, elephant, ant → Search: cat → Found  
Words: red, blue, green, yellow, purple → Search: pink → Not found
