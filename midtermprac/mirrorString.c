Topic: Strings, Character Pointers

Problem:
- Write a program that takes a string and reverses it using pointers only.
- Do not use strrev() or array indexing. Use char * and pointer math.

In baby terms:
You’ll move a pointer from the start and another from the end to swap characters until they meet in the middle.

Sample Input:

Enter a string: hello

Sample Output:

Reversed: olleh

Test Cases:

Input: "abcde" → "edcba"  
Input: "madam" → "madam"  
Input: "pointer" → "retniop"
