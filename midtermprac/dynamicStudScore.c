Topic: Dynamic Memory Allocation, Arrays

Problem:
- Create a program that asks how many students there are, dynamically allocates an array for their scores, and then:
- Finds the highest and lowest scores.
- Calculates the average score.

In baby terms:
You’ll use malloc() to make space for the scores while the program runs — you don’t predefine an array.

Sample Input:

Enter number of students: 4
Enter scores: 90 85 70 95

Sample Output:

Highest: 95
Lowest: 70
Average: 85.00

Test Cases:
Input: 3 → 100 50 75 → Highest: 100, Lowest: 50, Avg: 75.00  

Input: 5 → 60 70 80 90 100 → Highest: 100, Lowest: 60, Avg: 80.00
