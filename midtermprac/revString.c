Problem 1: Reverse String

Description:
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s. 
You must modify the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Function Signature (C):
void reverseString(char* s, int sSize);

Instructions:
1. Use two pointers: one starting at the beginning and one at the end.
2. Swap the characters at each pointer.
3. Move the pointers toward each other until they meet.

Example:
Input:  s = ['h','e','l','l','o']
Output: ['o','l','l','e','h']

Test Cases:
Input: ['H','a','n','n','a','h']
Output: ['h','a','n','n','a','H']

Input: ['a']
Output: ['a']
