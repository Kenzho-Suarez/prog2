Topic: Array Manipulation (Insertion)

Problem:
Write a program that:
- Takes an integer array and its size.
- Asks the user for a new number and a position.
- Inserts that number at the given position (shift the rest to the right).

In baby terms:
- You’ll pretend your array is like a line — when you insert something, the rest move over.
- Use a loop to shift elements.

Sample Input:

Enter array size: 5
Enter elements: 1 2 3 4 5
Enter number to insert: 99
Enter position (0-based): 2

Sample Output:

Array after insertion: 1 2 99 3 4 5

Test Cases:

Input: [10 20 30], insert 15 at 1 → [10 15 20 30]  
Input: [5 10 15 20], insert 100 at 0 → [100 5 10 15 20]
